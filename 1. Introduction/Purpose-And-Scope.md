# Purpose & Scope Definition

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive purpose and scope of the GitHub Copilot Test Generation Playbook for Spring Boot applications. It serves as a foundational guide for implementing test automation using GitHub Copilot.

## 2. Core Objectives

### 2.1 Primary Goal
To provide a structured, repeatable, and practical guide for using GitHub Copilot to generate and maintain various types of tests for Spring Boot applications, including:
- Unit Tests
- Integration Tests
- API Tests
- Regression Tests

### 2.2 Key Principles
- **Application Agnostic**: Applicable to any Spring Boot backend application
- **Universal Approach**: Suitable for new projects, legacy systems, and modernization efforts
- **Artifact-Driven**: Every step produces concrete, reusable outputs
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Addresses all major testing types systematically

## 3. Target Audience

### Primary Users
- Backend Java Developers
- Software Development Engineers in Test (SDETs)
- Quality Assurance Engineers

### Experience Levels
- Beginners in GitHub Copilot
- Experienced developers new to test automation
- Seasoned test automation engineers

## 4. Scope Elements

### 4.1 Testing Coverage
- Unit testing with JUnit and Mockito
- Integration testing for Spring Boot components
- API testing for REST endpoints
- Regression test suites
- Test validation and quality assurance

### 4.2 Workflow Components
- Repository-based documentation
- Step-by-step guides
- Copilot prompt templates
- Validation checklists
- Metrics collection
- Best practices documentation

### 4.3 Technical Requirements
- GitHub Copilot enabled IDE (IntelliJ/VS Code)
- Modern JUnit and Mockito frameworks
- Standard Java testing tools
- Spring Boot testing utilities

## 5. Expected Deliverables

### 5.1 Documentation
- Detailed prompt templates
- Step-by-step guides
- Best practices documentation
- Troubleshooting guides

### 5.2 Artifacts
- Code samples
- Test templates
- Validation checklists
- Metrics frameworks
- Quality assessment tools

### 5.3 Practical Resources
- Prompt refinement strategies
- Output validation methods
- Coverage measurement tools
- Quality metrics

## 6. Success Criteria

- Comprehensive test coverage across all types
- Reproducible test generation process
- Clear validation mechanisms
- Measurable quality metrics
- Practical, reusable artifacts
- Documentation for continuous improvement

## 7. Out of Scope

- Specific business logic implementation
- Non-Spring Boot frameworks
- Frontend testing
- Performance testing
- Security testing (except basic API security tests)

## 8. Next Steps

After understanding the purpose and scope:
1. Set up the development environment
2. Install required tools and dependencies
3. Begin with basic unit test generation
4. Progress through each test type systematically
