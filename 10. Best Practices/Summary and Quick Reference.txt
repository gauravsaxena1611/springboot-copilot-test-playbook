Summary and Quick Reference

To maximize your efficiency and the quality of tests generated by GitHub Copilot, internalize these core principles:

Provide Context, Context, Context: The more relevant code, comments, and explicit instructions you give, the better Copilot performs. Always include the full class and method, relevant dependencies, and Spring annotations.

Be Explicit About Intent: Clearly state what the test should achieve, what kind of test it is (unit, integration), and which frameworks to use.

Define Expected Behavior (GWT): Use "Given-When-Then" for scenarios, detail success paths, and exhaustively list error and edge cases with expected exceptions/outcomes.

Iterate and Refine: Don't expect perfection on the first try. Break down complex test generation into smaller steps and refine prompts based on Copilot's output.

Validate Critically: Always manually review generated code for hallucinations, brittleness, and logical correctness using the provided checklists. Integrate automated quality gates.

Use Templates: Leverage the provided prompt templates to ensure consistency and completeness across your team's test generation efforts.

By consistently applying this prompt strategy, you will transform GitHub Copilot from a simple code completion tool into a powerful, high-leverage assistant for building robust and reliable Spring Boot test suites.
