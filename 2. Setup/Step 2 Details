Step 2: Purpose & Scope Definition
1.1. Objective
Goal: Define what this repository is for, who it’s intended to help, and which scenarios it covers.

Audience: Java backend developers and SDETs, whether starting new projects or working with legacy Spring Boot services.

1.2. Inputs
None required. This step is foundational.

1.3. Activities
Draft a concise introductory section (for README.md) that captures the following:

The repository’s main aim: guiding teams to use GitHub Copilot for creating and maintaining unit, integration, API, and regression tests for any Java Spring Boot backend.

Project-agnostic design, enabling use for new, legacy, and modernization efforts.

Emphasis on artifact-driven, stepwise documentation.

Encouragement for both newcomers and experienced engineers to benefit from reusable prompts, templates, checklists, and practical validation methods.

1.4. Sample Content for README.md or Scope.md
text
## springboot-copilot-test-playbook

This repository is a complete, hands-on guide for using GitHub Copilot to generate and optimize automated tests (unit, integration, API, regression) in any Java Spring Boot backend project.

**Key Features:**
- Application-agnostic and modular—works for new, legacy, or evolving codebases.
- Step-by-step instructions, high-impact Copilot prompt templates, and practical artifacts at every stage.
- Designed for backend developers and SDETs, regardless of prior Copilot or test automation experience.
- Focuses on artifact-driven learning: every step produces reusable examples, validation checklists, metrics, and best practices.

**Intended Outcomes:**
- Accelerate high-quality test creation.
- Enable safe, maintainable, and future-proof code delivery.
- Foster best practices for test validation and prompt engineering with Copilot.

_Next steps: environment and tool setup_.
