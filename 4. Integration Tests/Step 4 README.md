# Step 4: Integration & API Test Generation

## Purpose

This step focuses on generating, refining, and documenting **integration tests** and **API (end-to-end) tests** for your Spring Boot backend, ensuring that components and systems work together correctly and HTTP endpoints function as expected.

You will leverage prior foundational information (Steps 1–3) to:

- Identify critical component interactions and service boundaries.
- Generate tests that cover inter-component communication, repository interaction, external integrations, and API endpoints.
- Use AI-assisted tooling with informed prompts to produce robust, relevant integration and API tests.

---

## Why Is This Step Important?

- Integration tests validate that combined components behave correctly together.
- API tests verify correct endpoint responses, data validation, security, and serialization.
- They catch issues missed by unit tests due to component boundaries or external system dependencies.
- Proper use of Step 1 context and Step 3 unit tests ensures efficient test layering and reduces redundant tests.

## Inputs

- Step 1–3 input artifacts and test coverage reports.
- Environment ready for test execution (including test databases or mocks).
- API specifications (if available).

---

## Prerequisite Checklist

- [ ] Unit testing coverage updated and gaps identified.
- [ ] Integration test dependencies installed (Spring Boot Test, Testcontainers, MockMvc, etc.).
- [ ] Test environment with DB or mocks configured if required.
- [ ] API design or OpenAPI specs available (optional but helpful).

---

## Step-by-Step Actions

### 1. Identify Critical Integration Points & API Endpoints

- Review the architecture diagram and functional workflows for component boundaries and API contracts.
- Document key service interactions (e.g., service-to-repository, service-to-external API).
- List public REST endpoints and their responsibilities.

### 2. Generate Integration Test Skeletons

- For each critical interaction or service combination, create integration test classes.
- For API endpoints, scaffold setup for MockMvc or TestRestTemplate tests.

### 3. Write Integration Test Cases

- Test combined component behavior (e.g., service + repository + DB).
- Include error handling, transaction boundaries, and edge cases.
- Validate persistence and query correctness as per data models.

### 4. Generate API Tests (End-to-End)

- Test HTTP endpoints for:
    - Correct status codes and responses.
    - Input validation and error handling.
    - Security and authentication enforcement.

### 5. Use Mocks and Real Components Selectively

- Mock external dependencies where needed as indicated in external dependencies inventory.
- Use real test databases or containers for database integration tests.

### 6. Review & Document Coverage

- Update integration/API test progress and coverage in `/integration-api-tests/integration-test-coverage.md`.
- Cross-reference with unit test coverage and team goals.

---

## Outputs

- Tests under `/src/test/java/` subdivided as needed (integration, api).
- `/integration-api-tests/integration-test-targets.md`: Classes and endpoints targeted.
- `/integration-api-tests/integration-test-coverage.md`: Coverage summary and open gaps.
- (Optional) API specs, test run logs, screenshots.

---

## Checklist

- [ ] Key integration points identified from Step 1 inputs.
- [ ] Integration test skeletons created.
- [ ] Integration test cases cover success and failure modes.
- [ ] API tests verify endpoints with positive and negative tests.
- [ ] External dependencies mocked and DBs containerized as needed.
- [ ] Coverage documented and aligned with unit test results and team goals.
- [ ] Test environment verified for reproducibility.
