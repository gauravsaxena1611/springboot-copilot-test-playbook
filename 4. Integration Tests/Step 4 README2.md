# Step 4: Integration Test Generation

## Purpose

Integration tests verify that the individual components of your Java Spring Boot application interact correctly when combined.  
This step focuses on testing the integration points between services, repositories, external systems, and databases — ensuring overall system coherence beyond unit tests.

---

## What Are Integration Tests?

- Integration tests check the correctness of collaboration between multiple components or modules.
- They test how service layers interact with repositories, external APIs, messaging systems, databases, and other backends.
- Unlike unit tests, these tests may use real or in-memory databases, mocks, or test containers to simulate production-like conditions.

---

## Why Integration Tests Matter

- Catch issues that unit tests cannot detect, such as misconfigured transactions, schema mismatches, or integration logic errors.
- Validate workflows spanning multiple layers/components.
- Serve as a safety net before extensive API or end-to-end testing.

## Inputs (From Previous Steps)

Ensure you have these finalized before starting integration tests:

| `/introduction/inputs/TeamGoalsTemplate.md`            | Prioritize tests based on business/testing goals             |
| `/environment-setup/environment-setup.md`              | Verify environment readiness for integration testing         |
| `/environment-setup/test-dependencies.md`              | Confirm presence of integration test tooling (Testcontainers, etc.)  |
| `/unit-tests/unit-test-coverage.md`                    | Confirm unit test coverage to avoid redundant tests          |

---

## Prerequisites

- Environment set up with database(s)—real, containerized, or in-memory.
- Test dependencies installed (Spring Boot Test, Testcontainers, Mockito, etc.).
- Project compiles and unit tests pass.
- Access to API specs (if available) for endpoint validation (optional).

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Identify Integration Test Targets

- Use `ArchitectureDiagramTemplate.md` and `FunctionalWorkflowTemplate.md` to list service-repository and inter-service communication points.
- Use `ServiceUtilityClassInventoryTemplate.md` to identify relevant services and repositories.
- Consider external system points from `ExternalDependencyTemplate.md`.

Complete the **Integration Test Targets Template** (`templates/IntegrationTestTargetsTemplate.md`) with:

- Classes/modules involved.
- Integration area (e.g., “Service-Repository”, “Service-External API”).
- Test class names.
- Status and notes.

### 2. Document Test Scenarios

- For each target, describe critical test scenarios in `TestScenarioTemplate.md` (example flows, error cases, transactional boundaries).

### 3. Scaffold Integration Test Classes

- Generate basic integration test classes using Spring Boot's `@SpringBootTest` and testcontainers if databases or services are external.
- Follow naming conventions compliant with Step 1 module definitions.

### 4. Write Integration Test Cases

- Cover success and failure paths.
- Test transactional integrity, data consistency, and error handling.
- Validate that workflows identified in `FunctionalWorkflowTemplate.md` properly function end-to-end between components.

### 5. Mock or Use Real External Dependencies

- Mock external services listed in `ExternalDependencyTemplate.md` when full integration is not possible or practical.
- Prefer real containerized DBs or service mocks for resilience.

### 6. Execute Tests and Gather Results

- Run integration tests and document coverage and any failures.
- Use `/integration-tests/integration-test-coverage.md` to track progress and gaps.

## Outputs

- `/src/test/java/**` — Integration test classes.
- `/integration-tests/integration-test-targets.md` — Documented targets and their test status.
- `/integration-tests/integration-test-coverage.md` — Coverage report and action list.
- `/integration-tests/test-scenarios/*.md` — Detailed test scenario descriptions.
- Optional logs or screenshots of test executions.
