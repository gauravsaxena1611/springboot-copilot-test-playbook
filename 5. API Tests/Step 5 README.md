# Step 5: API Test Generation

## Purpose

API tests validate the behavior of your Spring Boot application's HTTP endpoints, ensuring that:

- Requests to your REST controllers produce correct responses.
- Input validation, security, authentication, and error handling work as expected.
- Data serialization/deserialization is accurate.
- End-to-end flows at the API boundary conform to business requirements.

This step builds upon the foundational context from Steps 1–4—including project understanding, environment setup, unit tests, and integration tests—to deliver robust API-level coverage.

---

## What Are API Tests?

- Tests that directly exercise the application’s public HTTP endpoints.
- Typically use tools such as MockMvc, TestRestTemplate, WebTestClient, or external API testing frameworks.
- Should test all major HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for functional correctness and security.
- May also cover OpenAPI/Swagger specification validations (optional).

---

## Why Are API Tests Important?

- Provide confidence that API consumers (frontends, third parties, microservices) get the expected behavior.
- Catch issues missed by lower-level tests (serialization errors, global exception handling, access control).
- Form a key guardrail in the testing pyramid, ensuring contract integrity.

## Prerequisites

- Integration and unit tests are stable and coverage gaps accounted for.
- Environment includes appropriate API testing tools (MockMvc, RestTemplate, Postman/Newman, etc.).
- API documentation/specification is available or adequately reverse-engineered.
- Test dependencies for API testing are installed and tested.

---

## Step-by-Step Actions

### 1. Identify API Test Targets and Endpoints

- Use `FunctionalWorkflowTemplate.md` to list critical user journeys and API endpoints.
- Identify controllers and endpoints from `ArchitectureDiagramTemplate.md`.
- Map to workflows and modules from Step 1.

Fill out the **API Test Targets Template** (`templates/APITestTargetsTemplate.md`) documenting endpoints, HTTP methods, expected behavior, and test status.

### 2. Define API Test Scenarios

Use the **APITestScenarioTemplate.md** to detail tests for each endpoint, including:

- Valid input scenarios
- Error and validation tests
- Authentication and authorization cases
- Edge cases and boundary inputs

### 3. Scaffold API Test Classes

Generate test classes using MockMvc, TestRestTemplate, or WebTestClient to:

- Simulate HTTP requests
- Validate responses and HTTP status
- Assert JSON/XML response body structure and contents

### 4. Write Comprehensive API Tests

- Cover all important HTTP methods per endpoint.
- Include security tests (authenticated/unauthenticated, role-based access).
- Validate request parameter validations and error responses.
- Include content-type and serialization/deserialization tests.

### 5. Mock External Systems Where Needed

Mock or stub external dependencies outlined in `ExternalDependencyTemplate.md` to isolate API flows.

### 6. Execute and Document Test Runs

- Run API tests as part of CI or locally.
- Capture and maintain coverage and test run reports in `/api-tests/api-test-coverage.md`.
- Log failures and outstanding test scenarios.
