/**
 * === REGRESSION TEST GENERATION TEMPLATE ===
 *
 * BUG REFERENCE: [Bug ID, Issue Number, or Description, e.g., JIRA-1234: User deletion fails when associated with active orders]
 * FAILURE SCENARIO: [Description of the original failure, e.g., 'Attempting to delete a user who has active orders results in a 500 error instead of a Conflict (409) response.']
 * ROOT CAUSE: [What caused the original failure, e.g., 'Missing check for active orders before user deletion in UserService, leading to a foreign key constraint violation.']
 * FIX DESCRIPTION: [How the issue was resolved, e.g., 'Added `orderRepository.existsByUserIdAndStatus(userId, OrderStatus.ACTIVE)` check in `UserService.deleteUser()` and throws `UserHasActiveOrdersException` if true.']
 *
 * === ORIGINAL FAILURE CONTEXT ===
 * Component Affected: [Service, Controller, Repository, etc., e.g., `UserService`, `UserController`]
 * Failure Symptoms: [What behavior was observed, e.g., 'HTTP 500 Internal Server Error, SQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException in logs.']
 * Error Messages: [Specific errors or exceptions, e.g., 'SQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException: Foreign key constraint failed.']
 * Conditions for Failure: [What input/state caused the failure, e.g., 'User has at least one order with status `ACTIVE` or `PENDING` when DELETE /api/users/{id} is called.']
 *
 * === REPRODUCTION SETUP ===
 * Required Data State:
 * - [Database state needed to reproduce, e.g., 'A user (ID=1) exists, and an order (ID=101) exists associated with user ID 1 and status ACTIVE.']
 * - [Configuration settings needed, if any.]
 * - [External system states needed, if any.]
 *
 * Required Input:
 * - [Specific input values that triggered the bug, e.g., 'DELETE request to /api/users/1.']
 * - [Edge case conditions, e.g., 'User has a cancelled order, but no active orders.']
 * - [Timing or sequence requirements, if any.]
 *
 * === REGRESSION TEST SCENARIOS ===
 *
 * 1. Exact Original Failure Reproduction (Primary Regression Test)
 * - Purpose: Verify the specific bug is fixed and the expected, corrected behavior is exhibited.
 * - Setup: [Recreate exact conditions that caused failure, e.g., 'Create a user and an associated active order in test database.']
 * - Input: [Use exact input that caused failure, e.g., 'Call `userService.deleteUser(userId)` or perform `DELETE /api/users/{id}`.']
 * - Expected: [Correct behavior instead of failure, e.g., 'Should throw `UserHasActiveOrdersException` or return HTTP 409 Conflict.']
 * - Verification: [How to confirm fix works, e.g., 'Verify exception type and message, or assert HTTP status code and error response body.']
 *
 * 2. Boundary Condition Testing (No active orders)
 * - Purpose: Test edge cases around the bug area to ensure related functionality is not broken.
 * - Scenarios: [Related edge cases that might still fail, e.g., 'User has only *cancelled* orders.', 'User has no orders at all.']
 * - Input Variations: [Slightly different inputs near failure point, e.g., 'Delete user with only cancelled orders; delete user with no orders.']
 * - Expected: [Correct handling of all variations, e.g., 'Should successfully delete user.']
 *
 * 3. Load/Stress Testing (if applicable)
 * - Purpose: Verify fix works under load or concurrent access, especially if the bug was related to concurrency.
 * - Load Conditions: [Concurrent users, large datasets, e.g., 'Multiple concurrent requests to delete different users or the same user.']
 * - Expected: [Stable behavior under load, no deadlocks, no unexpected failures.]
 *
 * === RELATED FUNCTIONALITY TESTING ===
 * Areas That Might Be Affected by the Fix:
 * - [Related component 1, e.g., `OrderCancellationService`]: [Why it might be affected, e.g., 'Changes to order status validation might impact it.']
 * - [Related component 2, e.g., `ReportingService`]: [Why it might be affected, e.g., 'Ensuring user/order relationships are consistent for reports.']
 *
 * Test Coverage for Related Areas:
 * - [Existing functionality that must still work, e.g., 'Verify `OrderCancellationService` still correctly cancels orders.']
 * - [Integration points that must remain stable, e.g., 'Ensure `UserService.findUserOrders()` still works after changes.']
 * - [Performance characteristics that shouldn't degrade, e.g., 'User deletion should remain fast for users without orders.']
 *
 * === ERROR HANDLING VERIFICATION ===
 * Error Scenarios to Re-test:
 * - [Error condition 1, e.g., 'Delete user with invalid ID']: [How it should be handled post-fix, e.g., 'Still throws `UserNotFoundException` or 404.']
 * - [Error condition 2, e.g., 'Service unavailable during deletion']: [How it should be handled post-fix, e.g., 'Still throws `ServiceUnavailableException` or 503.']
 *
 * === MONITORING AND LOGGING ===
 * Logging Verification:
 * - [What should be logged when fix is working, e.g., 'Verify "User deletion prevented due to active orders" log message for the blocked case.']
 * - [What should be logged for related error conditions.]
 * - [Metrics that should be captured, e.g., 'A metric for `user_deletion_blocked_active_orders_count` is incremented.']
 *
 * === BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY (if applicable) ===
 * Compatibility Checks:
 * - [API contract compatibility, e.g., 'The error response format for user deletion remains consistent.']
 * - [Database schema compatibility, e.g., 'No unintended schema changes.']
 * - [Configuration compatibility, e.g., 'No new required configuration properties.']
 *
 * === GENERATION REQUIREMENTS ===
 * - Create tests that would have precisely caught the original bug.
 * - Include both positive (bug fixed) and negative (error handled) test cases.
 * - Test boundary conditions around the bug area (e.g., user with 0 orders, 1 active order, 1 inactive order).
 * - Verify improved error handling (e.g., specific exception types, correct HTTP status codes).
 * - Include integration tests if the bug was integration-related, ensuring full component interaction.
 * - Add performance tests if the bug was performance-related.
 * - Document the regression test purpose clearly, referencing the bug ID.
 * - Use descriptive test names that clearly indicate the scenario and bug (e.g., `shouldReturnConflictWhenDeletingUserWithActiveOrders_RegressionForJIRA1234()`).
 *
 * === TEST DOCUMENTATION (important for regression tests) ===
 * Each regression test should include:
 * ```java
 * /**
 * * Regression test for Bug #[ID, e.g., JIRA-1234]: [Bug Description, e.g., User deletion fails when associated with active orders]
 * *
 * * Original Issue: [Description of original failure, e.g., Attempting to delete user with active orders caused a 500 error due to FK violation.]
 * * Root Cause: [What caused the issue, e.g., Missing check for active orders before deletion.]
 * * Fix Applied: [How it was fixed, e.g., Added check for active orders and throws UserHasActiveOrdersException.]
 * *
 * * This test ensures the bug doesn't reoccur by:
 * * - Verifying that attempting to delete a user with active orders now correctly throws `UserHasActiveOrdersException` or returns HTTP 409.
 * * - Ensuring the user is NOT deleted from the database.
 * * - Verifying no unexpected exceptions occur.
 * */
 * @Test
 * void shouldNotDeleteUserWithActiveOrdersAndReturnConflict_RegressionForJIRA1234() {
 * // Test implementation goes here
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Generate comprehensive regression tests following this specification.
