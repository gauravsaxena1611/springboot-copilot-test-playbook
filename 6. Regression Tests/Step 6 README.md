# Step 6: Regression Test Suite Construction

## Purpose

Regression testing ensures that changes, bug fixes, or enhancements in your Spring Boot application do not break or degrade existing functionality.  
This step focuses on identifying key regression scenarios, generating or refining regression-focused tests, and maintaining a regression suite that evolves alongside your codebase.

---

## What Is Regression Testing?

- Re-running previously executed tests to verify that code changes have not introduced new defects.
- Targeting both new and existing features to ensure stability.
- Automating execution in CI/CD pipelines for early and continuous feedback.
- Includes unit, integration, API, and UI-level regression tests (our focus here is on backend tests).

---

## Why Regression Tests Matter

- Prevent unexpected bugs introduced by new code.
- Ensure confidence in releasing changes frequently.
- Detect side effects on critical or frequently used features.
- Support faster, reliable delivery cycles.

## Prerequisites

- Baseline unit, integration, and API test suites exist and are passing.
- CI/CD pipeline capable of running regression tests automatically.
- Test coverage and historical defect data are available.
- Clear understanding of code changes or impacted modules to guide focused regression.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Identify Regression Test Scenarios

- Analyze Step 1 workflows and business priorities to find critical regression scenarios.
- Review changelogs, bug reports, and recent code changes to highlight impacted areas.
- Use Step 5 API tests and Step 4 Integration tests coverage documents to find gaps.
- Categorize regression tests by priority: high (critical features), medium, low.

Document these in a **Regression Test Scenarios Template** (`templates/RegressionTestScenariosTemplate.md`).

### 2. Select Regression Test Cases

- Choose existing automated tests covering identified scenarios.
- Select new or enhanced tests from unit, integration, and API suites.
- Filter out obsolete or flaky tests to improve reliability and speed.

Maintain a **Regression Test Selection Template** (`templates/RegressionTestSelectionTemplate.md`) tracking selected, new, and removed tests.

### 3. Automate Regression Execution

- Integrate regression test runs into CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
- Set triggers for nightly builds, pre-release builds, or on-demand.
- Capture execution reports, including pass/fail trends, duration, and flaky test status.

Document pipeline and schedule in `/regression-tests/regression-execution.md`.

### 4. Maintain and Refine Regression Suite

- Review flakiness or failure causes and fix or quarantine flaky tests.
- Regularly update regression scenarios and test selection based on new features or defects.
- Use test prioritization to optimize runtime and feedback speed using techniques like test case prioritization and selection.

### 5. Track Metrics and Reporting

- Measure time savings, defect detection rate, and coverage improvements over time.
- Use these metrics to advocate for continued test investment and improvements.
- Document metrics in `/regression-tests/regression-metrics.md`.
