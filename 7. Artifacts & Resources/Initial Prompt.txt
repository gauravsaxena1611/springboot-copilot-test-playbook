Confirmation of the Research Playbook Plan for Using GitHub Copilot in Spring Boot Test Generation
Your plan for structuring a repeatable, practical, and generic GitHub-based playbook around GitHub Copilot for Java Spring Boot test generation is clear and comprehensive. Below is a structured confirmation that addresses each of your requirements and priorities. This ensures the final playbook will be actionable, easy to follow, and valuable for your intended audience.
1. Scope and Applicability
•
The playbook will be application-agnostic: it will not target any single Spring Boot app, but provide a universal, step-by-step guide usable with any legacy, new, or modernization project.
•
Each artifact, prompt, and result will be generic and adaptable for a wide range of backend Java projects.
2. Testing Types Covered
•
Unit, integration, API, and regression tests are all included.
•
Testing approaches will be documented one by one, with individual steps for each type of test—ensuring clarity, separation, and simplicity for every reader level.
3. Intended Audience
•
Aimed at backend developers and testers (including SDETs), whether experienced or new to Copilot and test automation.
•
Assumes no prior existing code or tests and guides the reader from scratch.
4. Repository-Based, Artifact-Driven Workflow
•
All steps, results, sample code, Copilot prompts, and validation checklists will be documented and stored within a dedicated GitHub repository.
•
Each process step will output concrete artifacts—code, Copilot suggestions, screenshots, metrics, etc.—with every output captured and organized for later reference or handoff between steps.
5. Exploratory and Scripted Approach
•
Each phase will include both scripted guidance (detailed prompts, example sequences, "what to expect" guidance) and exploratory tips (how to iterate, diagnose, or improve manual elements when Copilot’s output needs refinement).
•
Where full automation is not possible, the manual work and Copilot's possible usage will be clearly identified.
6. Prompt and Output Standardization
•
All prompts provided to Copilot will be as detailed and specific as the scenario requires, with context for best results.
•
Templates for prompts, validation, and test reviews will be included at every stage.
•
Validation steps will be integrated into each phase, with explicit prompts and checklists explaining how to:
o
Review Copilot’s output for correctness.
o
Refine and rerun prompts as needed.
o
Compare results against expected behaviors.
7. Baseline/Starting Point
•
The guide assumes the project is new, with all testing and codebase evolution to be recorded from first steps.
•
Also provides strategies and examples for legacy or in-progress modernization codebases.
8. Tooling and Prerequisites
•
Assumes Copilot is installed and enabled in IntelliJ (or VS Code).
•
Guidance assumes modern JUnit, Mockito, and standard Java testing tools are available.
9. Metrics, Validation, and Automation
•
Coverage and Copilot accuracy metrics will be captured and structured for easy assessment.
•
Automated steps will be added as progress allows, moving toward CI integration and demonstrating time savings and maintainability.
•
Validations are built into each step—providing not just prompts to Copilot, but also prompts for the reader to check and tune quality.
10. Documentation, Learnings, and Best Practices
•
Each section will include:
o
Key learnings (pitfalls encountered, Copilot limitations, best prompt strategies).
o
Guidance for prompt refinement.
o
Manual vs. automated task boundaries.
o
Suggestions for future improvements or scaling.
•
Best practices and actionable insights will close each step and the overall guide.
Final Assessment
You have thoroughly considered all essential aspects—scope, audience, types of projects, outputs at each step, validation, automation, and best practice synthesis. The plan covers all practical and learning facets for both beginner and experienced teams. There are no missing critical areas based on your current objectives and requirements.
You are ready to proceed to the next step: building out the actual structure and content for each stage in your GitHub repository.
If desired, you can now move forward with:
•
Creating the initial folder structure
•
Drafting the skeleton for each main step
•
Collecting base artifacts (sample project, test folders, readme templates, etc.)
