# ok generate detailed page for Step 2. Setup

Certainly! Below is a fully detailed Confluence page draft (rich in content and structure) for **Step 2: Environment \& Tool Setup** of your **springboot-copilot-test-playbook** project. This page follows the previously agreed Confluence blueprint, incorporates all relevant content from prior outputs, and integrates best practices, templates, sample prompts, validation techniques, and visual aids.

# Step 2: Environment \& Tool Setup

## 1. Overview

**Purpose:**
This step establishes the development, build, and test environments required for successful Spring Boot project execution. Setting up a consistent, standardized, and validated environment ensures all team members can seamlessly develop and run tests with identical configurations and tooling.

**When to perform:**
After Step 1 (Project Context \& Introduction) has produced foundational documentation and artifact templates, and before any test generation or execution steps begin.

**Outcome:**

- Development environment fully configured (IDEs, JDK, build tools, testing frameworks).
- Project workspace prepared, including Spring Boot project initialization.
- Continuous Integration (CI) environment and dependencies documented and operational.
- Environment readiness validated and ready for Steps 3+ (unit, integration, API testing).

**References:**

- Inputs from Step 1 artifacts: ProjectInfoTemplate.md for environment needs.
- Outputs to be referenced in Step 3 Unit Test Setup, Step 4 Integration Tests, etc.


## 2. Inputs \& Dependencies

| Artifact / Resource | Role \& Usage |
| :-- | :-- |
| `/introduction/inputs/ProjectInfoTemplate.md` | Review required Java versions, tools, environment specs |
| Local machine or server for development | Environment for team coding and testing |
| IDE installations (IntelliJ, VS Code, Eclipse) | Developer coding and debugging interface |
| Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+ | Required Java SDK for Spring Boot compilation \& runtime |
| Build Tools (Maven or Gradle) | Dependency management, build lifecycle |
| Spring Initializr or existing project base | Project skeleton and dependency starter |
| Test dependencies (JUnit, Mockito, etc.) | For unit and integration tests |
| CI/CD system and runners (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.) | Automated build and test execution framework |
| Environment configs (`application.properties`, YAML) | Base configuration for local and remote environments |

## 3. Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### 3.1 Install Java Development Kit (JDK)

- Install BellSoft Liberica or OpenJDK version 17 or higher (recommended for Spring Boot 3+).
- Verify installation:

```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

- Set necessary environment variables (`JAVA_HOME`) for your OS.


### 3.2 Choose and Setup an IDE

- Recommended IDEs:
    - **IntelliJ IDEA** (Community or Ultimate) with Spring Boot and Java plugins.
    - **Visual Studio Code** with *Spring Boot Extension Pack* and Java extensions.
    - **Eclipse IDE** with *Spring Tools Suite*.
- Configure project SDK in IDE matching installed JDK.
- Configure for Maven/Gradle build integration.
- Optional: Install Git plugins, terminal access, and debugging tools.


### 3.3 Create or Import Spring Boot Project

- Use [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io) to generate new starter project:
    - Select Maven or Gradle build, Java 17+ version, and Spring Boot stable release.
    - Add necessary dependencies (e.g., Spring Web, JPA, DevTools).
    - Download zip and extract locally.
- Alternatively, import existing project from source repository.
- Open in IDE and verify successful dependency resolution and project build.


### 3.4 Configure Build \& Test Dependencies

- Configure Maven/Gradle to include:
    - **JUnit 5** for unit tests.
    - **Mockito** for mocking dependencies.
    - **Spring Boot Test Starter** for integration testing.
    - **Testcontainers** if using containerized services for integration tests.
- Review `/environment-setup/test-dependencies.md` for exact current dependencies and versions.


### 3.5 Set Local Environment Configuration Files

- Create or update `/src/main/resources/application.properties` or `application.yml` with:
    - Server port (default 8080 or custom).
    - Database connection credentials (local).
    - Logging levels – set to INFO or DEBUG as preferred.
    - Profiles (`dev`, `test`, `prod`) to isolate environment-specific configuration.


### 3.6 Setup Continuous Integration Environment

- Confirm CI/CD system has:
    - JDK configured with required version.
    - Maven/Gradle build tools installed.
    - Ability to execute tests and gather reports.
- Validate pipeline scripts run clean builds and tests successfully.


### 3.7 Verify Environment \& Initial Build

- Run from your IDE or terminal:

```bash
mvn clean compile
mvn test
mvn spring-boot:run
```

- Verify application starts correctly and tests pass.
- Confirm IDE debugging and hot-reload features work.

## 6. Validation \& Refinement Guide

- **Validate environments:** Run checklist above, verify installations, verify build success.
- **Peer review environment config files:** Check `pom.xml` / `build.gradle` for dependency accuracy.
- **Cross-check project metadata against ProjectInfoTemplate.md:** Ensure consistency with planned versions/tools.
- **Refine configuration files and tool versions as needed until all tests pass cleanly.**
- **Use Copilot prompts iteratively for generating missing documentation or script snippets.**
- **Approval Criteria:** Environment is considered fully set up when:
    - All checklist items are marked DONE.
    - Build and tests execute successfully locally and via CI.
    - Documented installation info and environment config files are reviewed and stored in Confluence/repos.


## 7. Best Practices Table

| Activity | Best Practice | Validation Method |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| JDK Setup | Use supported LTS versions (Java 17 or 21 recommended) | Version check, test build execution |
| IDE Configuration | Standardize on a small set of IDEs with required plugins | Developer self-check, peer sharing |
| Build Tool Configuration | Centralized `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`, avoid duplicates | Peer review, automated build validation |
| Dependency Management | Use Spring Boot starters; keep versions consistent | Dependency audit tools (Maven/Gradle dependency check) |
| Environment Profiles | Use Spring Profiles for dev/test/prod isolation | Run app against profiles in tests |
| CI/CD Config | Automation of build and test steps; fail builds on errors | Run pipelines, observe logs |
| Documentation | Keep setup instructions up to date and versioned | Manual review during sprint/release cycles |
