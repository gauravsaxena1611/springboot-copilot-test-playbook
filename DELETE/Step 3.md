# ok generate detailed confluence page for step 3. Unit Tests

Certainly! Below is a fully detailed Confluence page draft for **Step 3: Unit Test Generation** of your **springboot-copilot-test-playbook** project. This content is aligned with the blueprint structure we agreed on, integrates best practices from recent authoritative sources, includes templates, sample prompts, validation practice, and a flowchart instruction—fully self-contained and ready for Confluence page creation.

# Step 3: Unit Test Generation

## 1. Overview

**Purpose:**
Unit tests verify the smallest testable parts of the Spring Boot application (e.g., individual methods, service classes) to ensure they work correctly in isolation. This step guides through identifying unit test targets, creating skeletons, writing meaningful test cases, and validating thorough coverage.

**When to perform:**
After environment setup (Step 2) is complete and before starting integration or API tests.

**Outcome:**

- Well-structured unit test classes exist for services, repositories, utilities, and controllers where applicable.
- Unit tests effectively mock dependencies to isolate tested units.
- Coverage gaps are identified and documented for future testing or regression focus.

**References:**

- Inputs from Step 1 templates (ProjectInfo, ServiceUtilityClassInventory, FunctionalWorkflow, DataModel).
- Environment confirmation from Step 2.
- Outputs feed into integration tests (Step 4), API tests (Step 5), and Regression suite (Step 6).


## 2. Inputs \& Dependencies

| Artifact / Resource | Role \& Usage |
| :-- | :-- |
| `/introduction/inputs/ProjectInfoTemplate.md` | Project context, modules identification |
| `/introduction/inputs/ServiceUtilityClassInventoryTemplate.md` | Services and utility classes as test targets |
| `/introduction/inputs/FunctionalWorkflowTemplate.md` | Workflows to guide test scenario coverage |
| `/introduction/inputs/DataModelTemplate.md` | Entity data and relations for mock and assertion context |
| `/environment-setup/environment-setup.md` | Confirm JDK, IDE, build tools, and dependencies |
| Test dependencies (JUnit 5, Mockito, Spring Boot Test) | For writing and executing tests |

## 3. Step-by-Step Guide

### 3.1 Identify Unit Test Targets

- Review `ServiceUtilityClassInventoryTemplate.md` for classes/services requiring coverage.
- Use the architecture and workflow templates to prioritize critical modules for immediate unit testing.
- Focus on classes containing business logic, data transformations, and utilities.


### 3.2 Scaffold Unit Test Classes

- Create test classes corresponding to target classes using Spring Boot testing annotations (e.g., `@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)` if needed).
- Use the correct test package structure mirroring production code.
- Setup `@Mock` or `@MockBean` dependencies using Mockito to isolate unit tests.
- Initialize mocks with `MockitoAnnotations.openMocks(this)` or use Spring support annotations.


### 3.3 Write Unit Test Methods

- Aim for **single responsibility per test**: one scenario, one assertion group.
- Name tests clearly, e.g., `whenValidInput_thenExpectedResult()` or `whenNullArg_thenThrowException()`.
- Cover:
    - Happy paths
    - Error paths (exceptions, invalid inputs)
    - Boundary conditions (empty lists, max/min values)
- Mock external dependencies and interactions—even repositories or utilities—using Mockito behavior specifications.
- Use assertions from JUnit or AssertJ for readable and expressive validation.


### 3.4 Manage Code Coverage and Gaps

- Use JaCoCo or similar tooling to generate coverage reports.
- Document coverage % per class/module in `/unit-tests/unit-test-coverage.md`.
- Identify coverage gaps focusing on critical or complex business logic.
- Track uncovered classes or methods in `/unit-tests/unit-test-targets.md`.


### 3.5 Validate Test Quality

- Ensure tests are **fast, deterministic, and independent**: No shared state, no reliance on ordering.
- Avoid testing framework or third-party library code.
- Review and refactor tests regularly based on failures, flakiness, or coverage reports.


## 4. Templates \& Examples

### 4.1 Unit Test Targets Template (Blank)

```markdown
# Unit Test Targets

| Class/Module Name              | Test Class Name           | Status (Not Started/In Progress/Complete) | Notes/Linked Workflow            |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| UserService                   | UserServiceTest           | Not Started                               | User registration workflow      |
| OrderService                 | OrderServiceTest          | In Progress                              | Order processing workflow       |
| UtilityClassX                | UtilityClassXTest         | Complete                                 |                                 |

---

## Instructions:
- List all classes/services targeted for unit testing.
- Specify test class names and current test progress.
- Add notes for specific scenarios or dependencies.
```


### 4.2 Sample Filled Unit Test Targets

```markdown
# Unit Test Targets (Example)

| Class/Module Name              | Test Class Name           | Status       | Notes/Linked Workflow             |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------|
| UserService                   | UserServiceTest           | Complete     | Covers all main responsibilities |
| OrderService                 | OrderServiceTest          | In Progress | Adding exception case tests       |
| PaymentUtils                 | PaymentUtilsTest          | Not Started | Utilities used in Order processing |
```


### 4.3 Sample Unit Test Class Skeleton (Java)

```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class UserServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    @InjectMocks
    private UserService userService;

    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        // Optional setup code
    }

    @Test
    void whenValidId_thenUserShouldBeFound() {
        Long id = 1L;
        User user = new User(id, "John Doe");
        Mockito.when(userRepository.findById(id)).thenReturn(Optional.of(user));

        User found = userService.findUserById(id);

        Assertions.assertNotNull(found);
        Assertions.assertEquals("John Doe", found.getName());
    }

    @Test
    void whenInvalidId_thenExceptionThrown() {
        Long id = 2L;
        Mockito.when(userRepository.findById(id)).thenReturn(Optional.empty());

        Assertions.assertThrows(UserNotFoundException.class, () -> {
            userService.findUserById(id);
        });
    }
}
```

## 6. Validation \& Refinement

**Validation Techniques:**

- **Manual peer reviews:** Readability, logic, and naming conventions.
- **Static analysis:** Ensure test code conforms to standards.
- **Run tests frequently:** Confirm no flaky or failing tests.
- **Cross-reference coverage reports** for untested areas.
- **Check mocks:** Avoid mocking actual logic; mock only external calls.
- **Definition of Done:** All critical class units have passing tests covering normal and edge cases, and coverage meets team goals.

**Refinement Approach:**

- Use iterative development with Copilot prompts to improve tests.
- Refine mocks and assertions incrementally.
- Add new test cases as new business edges or bugs are discovered.
- Periodically update test coverage reports and adjust targets.

**Approval:**

- Tests signed off by QA/Lead developer.
- Added to coverage summary and traceability docs.
- Stored in the version control system and documented in `/unit-tests/` directory and corresponding Confluence step page.
