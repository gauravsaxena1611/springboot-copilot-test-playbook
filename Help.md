## Structure
Each Step follows exact same actionable, modular, and template-driven style:

- Clear, checklist-driven README.md for /environment-setup (or /setup).
- Detailed templates for capturing environment/tooling details.
- A real prompts library focused on Copilot/IDE setup and artifact generation.
- Explicit guidance for manual, Copilot-driven, and hybrid stepsâ€”generalized for any Java/Spring Boot project.
